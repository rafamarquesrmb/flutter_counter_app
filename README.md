# Counter App

  

This is a very simple and introductory project with Flutter! To be more exact, it is my first Flutter app and first contact with the "Dart" programming language.

  
  

## Inspiration:

  

I was inspired by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/)'s first class accountant project for "NextLevelWeek 6" event (in flutter). However, using the [official flutter documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs) and material design, I looked for new widgets and added some different functions from the exercise proposed in the class.

  

## About:

It is a counter application with add, remove and reset functions.

  

When reaching "0", it is not possible to decrease the counter.
